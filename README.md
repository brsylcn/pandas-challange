# pandas-challange

I used Pandas library, Jupyter NoteBook and Python to analyze user data for a video game company in this project. I reviewed data related purchases items and average of purchases. I aggregated and analyze the data to view trends in the purchasing behavior of the players. I checked and anylyzed the age ranges and relation between ages and game purchases. 

** I added my key observations on the notebook as a markdown.
